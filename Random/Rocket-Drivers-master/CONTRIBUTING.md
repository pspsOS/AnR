# Contributing

1. Please limit contributions to members of PSP or RRaP only. This code will be helping to decide the gimbal angle for the Atlas platform for RRaP. Errors in flight software could be catastrophic in nature, so any changes by unapproved entities will most likely be removed.

2. Please use branches for everything. Unless you're me (the person tasked with writing the drivers) changes should be completed with branches to ensure accuracy in code. As of right now, everything is being pushed to master since nothing is tested. But in the future, please limit contributions to branches.
