/*
 * Notes:
 *
 * As of now, the rocket struct is here simply because I don't know where you guys will want it. Typically, I just declare one rocket_t variable and extern it
 * such that the whole application can access the data. There isn't really a chance that there will be errors with using a global since there's really only
 * one overall data structure.
